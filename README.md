## Why Create Console Tools in PHP?
Great question.  Some people would say "Don't" - and depending on your situation, I might tell you
the same.  Here are some of the reasons I do reach for PHP:

 - It's the language I currently work with the most (so I can write quickly in it)
 - It's the language most of my teammates work with the most (so they can contribute easily)
 - It allows me to practice and build many re-usable techniques and methods in PHP for re-use in
   other projects
 - I and my team generally have it installed on our workstations already
 - Most systems I work with use the LAMP stack, so they typically have PHP available in the shell by
   default
 - It's good enough for most of my use-cases.  If I need a compiling, fast,
   multi-platform, multi-threading language to build for wider distribution, I'll probably use
   [Go](http://golang.org).
